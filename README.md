# Rainfall Storage Prediction

The Rainfall Storage Prediction project aims to predict the amount of rainfall storage capacity based on historical weather data, particular place, date and potential rainfall. The project applies advanced machine learning (ML) techniques to provide accurate forecasts, helping planners in water management, agriculture, and urban planning.

# Technologies Used
- **Python:** For data manipulation, analysis, and building machine learning models.
- **Pandas & NumPy:** Libraries used for data preprocessing and manipulation.
- **Scikit-learn:** ML library for implementing various algorithms such as Random Forest, SVM, etc.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization and understanding correlations.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** For iterative development and experimentation.
- **Streamlit:** For deploying the model.

# Machine Learning Algorithms

- **Random Forest:**
A powerful ensemble method that combines the predictions of multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and prevent overfitting.
Used for both regression and classification tasks. In this project, it helps in capturing complex relationships between environmental factors and rainfall storage.

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM):**
A robust classification and regression algorithm. In the case of rainfall prediction, SVM can be employed to find the optimal boundary that maximizes the margin between different data points (such as rainy and non-rainy periods).

- **Linear Regression:**
One of the simplest and most interpretable models, used to predict a continuous target variable (rainfall storage capacity) based on input features. This could be useful for understanding basic trends in the data.

- **Decision Trees:**
A model that breaks down data into smaller subsets while developing an associated decision tree. The final result is a tree with decision nodes and leaf nodes that can be used to predict rainfall.

# Process Flow

- **Data Collection:** Collect historical rainfall and environmental data from weather stations or online sources like government databases.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and normalize data, handle missing values, and engineer new features such as seasonality.
- **Model Building:** Train multiple machine learning models, perform hyperparameter tuning, and evaluate models.
- **Evaluation:** Use metrics like Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to evaluate the accuracy of predictions.
- **Deployment:** Implement the final model in a user-friendly interface where real-time or batch predictions are made for rainfall storage capacity.
