Rainfall Storage Prediction
The Rainfall Storage Prediction project aims to predict the amount of rainfall storage capacity based on historical weather data, particular place, date and potential rainfall. The project applies advanced machine learning (ML) techniques to provide accurate forecasts, planners in water management, agriculture, and urban planning.
